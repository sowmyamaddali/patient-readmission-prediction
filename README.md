# patient-readmission-prediction
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of a patient being readmitted to the hospital within 30 days of discharge using the MIMIC-III 10k dataset. The goal is to support hospital systems in identifying high-risk patients and improving post-discharge planning to reduce readmission rates.
