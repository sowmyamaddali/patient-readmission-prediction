# Predicting 30-Day Patient Readmission Using MIMIC-III 10k Dataset

## Project Overview
Hospital readmissions within 30 days are a key indicator of healthcare quality and operational efficiency. In this project, we use a subset of the MIMIC-III clinical dataset (10k patients) to build a predictive model that flags patients at high risk of being readmitted after discharge.

## Objective
To develop a machine learning model that predicts 30-day readmission using structured patient data, including demographics, diagnosis codes, and hospital admission history.

## Dataset
- **Source:** [MIMIC-III 10k on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bilal1907/mimic-iii-10k)
- **Size:** ~6.48 GB
- **Content:** Patient demographics, admissions, diagnoses, discharge times, and readmission status.

<!--- ## Tools & Technologies
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Kaggle Notebooks
- GitHub for version control

## Key Steps
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
3. Model Building (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
4. Model Evaluation (ROC AUC, Precision, Recall)
5. Interpretability (Optional: SHAP)
6. Conclusion & Next Steps

## Business Impact
Accurate readmission predictions can help hospitals allocate follow-up care more effectively, reduce costs, and improve patient outcomes.

## Next Steps
- Deploy as a Streamlit web app for clinical use
- Incorporate unstructured text from clinical notes (e.g., discharge summaries)
